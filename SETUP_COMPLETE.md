## 🚀 Next Steps: GitHub Repository Creation

Since your local Git repository is ready, you now need to create a GitHub repository and push your code:

### Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website

1. **Go to GitHub**
   - Visit https://github.com/new
   - Sign in to your GitHub account

2. **Create Repository**
   - Repository name: `customers` or `customer-management-system`
   - Description: "Comprehensive Customer Management System with Next.js and FastAPI"
   - Choose Public or Private
   - **❌ DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license** (we already have these)

3. **Connect Your Local Repository**
   ```bash
   # Add GitHub as remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   
   # Push main branch
   git checkout main
   git push -u origin main
   
   # Push develop branch
   git checkout develop
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

### Option 2: Create Repository via GitHub CLI (if you have it)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
winget install GitHub.GitHubCLI

# Create repository and push
gh repo create customer-management-system --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## 🔧 Immediate Development Workflow

Your repository is now ready for professional development! Here's how to work:

### Making Changes
```bash
# Always work on feature branches from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # (after you push to GitHub)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes...
# ... development work ...

# Commit with conventional commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of your feature"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create Pull Request on GitHub to merge into develop
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run before committing
npm run lint          # ESLint checking
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm run build         # Build verification
```
